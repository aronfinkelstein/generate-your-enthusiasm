# Generate Your Enthusiasm

As an engineering student, I am often told that I can use my new-found knowledge and technical expertise to help change the world for the better. This has always inspired in me a determination to push the boundaries of technology and help to nudge humanity forward into a utopian, post-scarcity future in which all struggles are a distant memory. I therefore naturally decided that a greater understanding of the HBO-series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, would contribute massively to this dream.

Penicillin was discovered accidentally, as were microwaves, x-rays, pace-makers. Even Play-Doh. Throughout this project I have been accutely aware that even the analysis of one episode, might lead to the discovery of a cure to a terminal illness or even a new childs toy. I haven't discovered either of those yet, but I also might have unknowingly, that's the trouble with trying to discover something accidentally I guess.

Anyway, I think it was Einstein or someone equally important, that wrote 'Larry David's writing is the key to humanities' greatest secrets and possibly the meaning of life' (I might be paraphrasing). I am astonished that this analysis has been left to an under-graduate student, clearly government research-funding needs to be reprioritised. Nonetheless, I have dedicated myself to this research entirely, possibly at the expense of my behaviour-of-dynamic-systems revision, but I am convinced that the humanitarian impact of this work will be worth the significant cost to my career prospects.

If only Mr. David would just reveal his secrets...

## Data Collection

In order to train the model, I considered various data types. Curb is an improvised show and therefore, scripts aren't actually available. I could have used transcripts or subtitles, but I couldn't find a source that had labelled scripts, just the transcription of speech. Instead, I decided to use the imdb and wikipedia synopsis for each episode as training data.
