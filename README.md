In order to train the model, I considered various data types. Curb is an improvised show and therefore, scripts aren't actually available. I could have used transcripts or subtitles, but I couldn't find a source that had labelled scripts, just the transcription of speech. Instead, I decided to use the imdb synopsis for each episode as training data.
