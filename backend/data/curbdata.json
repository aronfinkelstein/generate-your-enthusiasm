On the plane, Larry is scolded for not switching off his phone, and immediately snitches on Leon and Jeff amidst the argument. Arriving in Atlanta, Larry is blocked from entering an exit by a woman on Interstate 85. At a hotel, Larry is accidentally hit with a ball by a child, and the mother tries to force her son to apologize to him. Larry is annoyed by the situation, and tells the boy that he never learned a lesson in his life. While talking with Richard Lewis, Larry is dismayed when he finds that Richard's date, Cynthia (Allison Janney), is the same woman from I-85, although Cynthia claims she was never there. Before the trial, Larry follows Cynthia, after hearing that she told Richard that she attempted suicide after Richard broke up with her. He is even more suspicious when Cynthia cannot fully detail her suicide attempt, upsetting Richard for interfering in his life. Larry and his lawyer, Sibby Sanders (Sanaa Lathan) arrive at the trial, with some protesters supporting him outside, one of whom is Ted Danson. At the trial, District Attorney Earl Mack (Greg Kinnear) points Larry as a danger to society for his actions, while Sibby uses her testimony to challenge the Election Integrity Act of 2021. During her testimony, Larry is annoyed by a fly and kills it in front of the jurors. Mack calls many character witnesses to testify. The first is Mocha Joe (Saverio Guerra), who brings up the time Larry insulted him and opened a spite store next to his business, also accusing him of burning it down.[a] The next witness is Matsue Takahashi (Dana Lee), who relates how Larry hit Troy Kotsur with a golfball,[b] and also killed Kyoko, Takahashi's black swan.[c] The next witness is Alexander Vindman, who accuses Larry of bribing a councilwoman.[d] That night, Larry and Jeff manage to obtain the secret recipe for a salad dressing from Auntie Rae (Ellia English), which Jeff gives to Susie for their anniversary. As he discusses the case with his friends, Larry receives advice from Leon; he must draw compassion from the jury to win them over. The following day, Susie enters the court room as a wheelchair-bound lover of Larry, with Larry faking good deeds to improve his image. Mack then brings Rachel Heinemann (Iris Bahr), who relates how Larry forced her to jump off a ski lift due to her strict observance of her Orthodox Judaism.[e] Another witness is Maureen (Jillian Bell), who states Larry urinated on her portrait of Jesus.[f] More include the maitre'd from Katsuya (Sonny Saito), who complains over Larry yelling as a greeting to two chefs;[g] Irma (Tracey Ullman), who reveals that Larry stole a pair of shoes from an exhibit at the Holocaust Museum LA;[h] Bruce Springsteen, who accuses Larry of ruining his tour by giving him COVID-19;[i] and Tara Michaelson (Bailey Thompson), who claims that Larry had an erection while she hugged him as a child.[j] Sibby summons Rae to support Larry, but she angrily goes on a tirade by calling Larry and Jeff out for stealing her recipe. Realizing this is where her gift came from, Susie ends the charade and walks out of the room. The case is withheld until the following day, but Larry is losing support. At a bar, Larry runs into Jerry Seinfeld. The following day, Larry testifies, and acts compassionate by claiming he just wanted to help Rae as there was nothing to cover her from the sun. Mack then questions Larry, asking him to remember many of his misdeeds; such as stealing flowers from a roadside memorial for Ida Funkhouser;[k] taking a 5-wood golf club from Leo Funkhouser's hand at his funeral;[l] breaking into head councilman Weinblatt's house to retrieve an incriminating letter;[m] and the 'beloved cunt' typo in Louise's obituary.[n] Mack mentions more of Larry's misdeeds to the jury which includes refusing to give candy to two trick-or-treating girls on Halloween because they are not wearing costumes;[o] exhuming the corpse of his mother Adele;[p] inviting Rick, the convicted sex offender, to a Passover Seder;[q] eating Oscar's last meal which was ice cream;[r] having sex with a blow up doll in front of Cheryl;[s] teaching Greg how to knit a swastika pillow sham for Susie;[t] hiring a prostitute named Monena as his passenger;[u] and lying over being abused by his uncle Leo at an incest survivors group.[v] Mack uses all of this to point that the Act is required to prevent society from ending due to people like Larry. Finally, the jury reaches a verdict: Larry is declared guilty. Judge Whittaker (Dean Norris) notes how Larry kept committing mistakes, telling him he hopes he finally learned a lesson, and sentences him to one year in prison. While sitting in his cell, Larry converses with an inmate (Tarnue Massaquoi) over the appearance of an erection caused by the fabric of his pants bunching up, referred to as a 'pants tent', which was referenced in (and gave its name to) the first episode of the series. Suddenly, Seinfeld shows up, telling Larry that he met one of the jurors (Martin Carlin) at a Mexican restaurant the previous night. This violated the jury sequestration, causing a mistrial and Larry is allowed to be released. As he walks off, Larry tells Seinfeld, 'this is how we should've ended the finale', and both express disappointment for not coming up with it before. On the flight back home, Larry and his friends get into an argument when Susie opens the plane's window shade.",

She does not believe that Larry is capable of it. Cheryl gives Larry until the anniversary to claim his present.At the opening, Larry realizes that the number written on the chef's arm, which led him to believe that the chef was a holocaust survivor, was only a lottery number.\nAll is well, until Guy utters a string of obscenities & the place goes quiet. To avert disaster, Larry starts screaming obscenities, remembering the bald pledge scene from Sammi's school. Soon, the other patrons join in & it turns out to be a great night.",

Larry thinks Matt is a terrible director.\nHe and Antoinette discuss that Matt has a son with some sort of disability. Matt drops in and, sure enough, tells Larry he's been stuck in the Dramedy ghetto and would like his help with Lewis's pilot. Cornered, Larry agrees to recommend him to Richard.

Later, while the two couples wait in line at the movies, a retarded man makes his way loudly to the front of the line, cutting in front to buy his ticket. When they see him inside the theater, Larry points out to Paula that the man is not actually retarded; he faked it. During the film, both Larry and Paula squirm in their seats but when they ask each other what's wrong, neither one will admit to any discomfort.When Paula wants to leave the movie minutes before the end, Larry refuses to go with her. Paula leaves and Susie urges Larry to go after her. Larry is surprised Paula is gone when they emerge just 6 minutes later.The next day, when Larry sees a man looking at the office next door, Larry fakes being retarded, telling the man he's excited he'll be his neighbor and they have to go to lunch together every day.

When he is outraged, she invokes the unwritten law of dry cleaning and tells him what's done is done.At the NRDC opening, Larry complains about the stain while talking to Jeff and Ted and Jeff confesses that it was actually him. Jeff did it at Passover at Larry's, explaining he got bored but then couldn't clean it up because he had to rush to get back for the 4 questions.\nMeanwhile, when Larry sees that the other wing was donated by \"Anonymous,\" he gets upset. Now it looks like he just did it for the credit. His distress escalates when Cheryl tells him Ted is Anonymous, and, in fact, everyone seems to know this, including Senator Boxer, who's giving the opening remarks. It's faux anonymity, Larry insists, fuming.\nWhen Larry brings up the dry-cleaning issue to Senator Boxer, complaining that there's no regulation of the industry, she tells him that's just the rule of dry cleaning, and that she, in fact is wearing someone else's pants she got from the dry cleaner.Ted ends up telling Cheryl that Jeff is the one who masturbated and Cheryl bans Jeff from their house. Larry goes to give the news to Jeff, and they are both peeved at Ted for being a little difficult.

She bans Larry from her house in retaliation.Larry invites Leon out for a drive and apologizes for blaming him for the stain. While they're out, Larry spots an Asian man wearing a #25 Yankees jersey and tells Leon it's his.

Desperate to use the bathroom, Larry stops by Jeff and Susie's (Susie Essman) and begs Susie to use the bathroom in spite of the fact he's banned. She acquiesces. Later, Leon and Larry spot another man wearing #25 and Larry realizes the first jersey wasn't his after all. This one, however, worn by a board member of the NRDC, is Larry's - the man admits he got it from the dry cleaner but insists that means it's his now. They argue and the man finally tells Larry he's taking his name off the wing. Larry couldn't be happier. \"Put anonymous!\" he shouts.Larry and Leon are home playing cards when Susie busts in, furious because her daughter Sammi (Ashly Holloway) has found ejaculate on her teddy bear shortly after Larry's visit. Larry insists it wasn't him. \"So, it's anonymous?\" Susie shouts. Cheryl overhears and tells her that Ted is Anonymous. Susie, shocked, takes off after Ted.Larry walks down the street in his #25 jersey when the Asian man Leon took the jersey from, spots him.
