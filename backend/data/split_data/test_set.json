He and Jean have a big argument over how Jean should have waved Larry, when he wasn't able to find her in the dark.

Jean is offended by the suggestion.At the golf club, Larry also offends Sal by trying to \"reset\" their relationship. The club's owner, Mr. Takahashi (Dana Lee), learns of Larry's remarks about Ken's child.

Larry is mildly annoyed that nobody ever comes to meet him & that meetings with him are never at his office.Larry has a run-in with professional wrestler Thor Olsen (Deron Mcbree). Thor accuses Larry of \"shooting at his kids\", Larry & Thor's kids were playing Cowboys and Indians with each other while Larry was driving behind Thor's car. Thor threatens Larry for teaching violence to his kids. Thor slashes Larry's tires before driving away.Larry calls AAA, but they tell him that Cheryl has canceled their membership of AAA. Cheryl believes that AAA is a political organization with no regard for the environment. AAA just wants more cars to be sold so that they can have more and more business for themselves.Larry has a tough time changing the tires all by himself (and for the first time in his life). Larry gets a lot of advice from people who walk by on how to do it, but nobody offers to help. Larry then even offers $35 to change the tire to anyone who helps him, but nobody steps up. Larry offers $10 for a verbal response and even this fails to elicit any response from anybody.As a result, Larry is late for his meeting with Jason. They decide to meet the next day. Jason again wants to Larry to drive down, but now Larry insists that Jason should drive to his office instead. Then they get into an argument about that they were supposed to have a meeting in Jason's office, which did not happen, according to Jason, & hence Larry should drive down. While Larry claims that he did drive down & so now its Jason's turn. Jason sticks to his contention that the plan was to have a meeting, and the meeting never took place. Larry says that driving is the issue and not the meeting.Jason tells Larry that he knows Thor and that Thor is in town for some big wrestling event.Meanwhile, Jeff separates from Susie, and asks Larry to go pick up his clothes. Doing so incurs the wrath of Susie (Susie Essman). Susie is angry at Jeff for sending Larry to do his dirty stuff. Susie knows all about Jeff's porno collection. Larry finds Thor's car parked at the same hotel where Jeff is staying. Larry had driven Jeff's mom to the hotel and during the way she had leaned over the front seats to get a pen from the back seat of the car. Larry asks Jeff to repay the favor by letting the air out of Thor's tires. Jeff is caught, meanwhile Larry tells Thor's kids that wrestling is fake.Jeff is afraid of divorce as he doesn't want his sexual history with Susie to come out in the open. This puts Larry on guard against saying anything that can be misconstrued as weird or kinky to anybody. This makes Larry very sensitive to any kinky sex talk with Cheryl. Cheryl suggests that Larry wants to have kinky afternoon sex with her, and Larry gets very defensive.Larry makes a bad greeting to one of their colored neighbors Wanda (Wanda Sykes). Wanda was walking down the street when Larry drove by and commented that he would know that tush anywhere. When Cheryl confronts Larry later in the day, Larry says that he was being chummy and didn't mean anything else by his comment. Cheryl says that Larry should not comment about anyone's rear ends. Cheryl deduces that Larry likes big rear ends. This is when Wanda drops by, and Larry's comments lead Wanda and Cheryl to believe that Larry has some kind of rear end fetish.Cheryl receives a traffic violation in the mail which contains a photo of the time of the incident. Larry is staring at Jeff's mom's rear end as she was leaning over the front seats. Her suspicions are confirmed.",

Thor threatens Larry for teaching violence to his kids. Thor slashes Larry's tires before driving away.Larry calls AAA, but they tell him that Cheryl has canceled their membership of AAA. Cheryl believes that AAA is a political organization with no regard for the environment. AAA just wants more cars to be sold so that they can have more and more business for themselves.Larry has a tough time changing the tires all by himself (and for the first time in his life). Larry gets a lot of advice from people who walk by on how to do it, but nobody offers to help. Larry then even offers $35 to change the tire to anyone who helps him, but nobody steps up. Larry offers $10 for a verbal response and even this fails to elicit any response from anybody.As a result, Larry is late for his meeting with Jason. They decide to meet the next day. Jason again wants to Larry to drive down, but now Larry insists that Jason should drive to his office instead. Then they get into an argument about that they were supposed to have a meeting in Jason's office, which did not happen, according to Jason, & hence Larry should drive down. While Larry claims that he did drive down & so now its Jason's turn. Jason sticks to his contention that the plan was to have a meeting, and the meeting never took place. Larry says that driving is the issue and not the meeting.Jason tells Larry that he knows Thor and that Thor is in town for some big wrestling event.Meanwhile, Jeff separates from Susie, and asks Larry to go pick up his clothes. Doing so incurs the wrath of Susie (Susie Essman). Susie is angry at Jeff for sending Larry to do his dirty stuff. Susie knows all about Jeff's porno collection. Larry finds Thor's car parked at the same hotel where Jeff is staying. Larry had driven Jeff's mom to the hotel and during the way she had leaned over the front seats to get a pen from the back seat of the car. Larry asks Jeff to repay the favor by letting the air out of Thor's tires. Jeff is caught, meanwhile Larry tells Thor's kids that wrestling is fake.Jeff is afraid of divorce as he doesn't want his sexual history with Susie to come out in the open. This puts Larry on guard against saying anything that can be misconstrued as weird or kinky to anybody. This makes Larry very sensitive to any kinky sex talk with Cheryl. Cheryl suggests that Larry wants to have kinky afternoon sex with her, and Larry gets very defensive.Larry makes a bad greeting to one of their colored neighbors Wanda (Wanda Sykes). Wanda was walking down the street when Larry drove by and commented that he would know that tush anywhere. When Cheryl confronts Larry later in the day, Larry says that he was being chummy and didn't mean anything else by his comment. Cheryl says that Larry should not comment about anyone's rear ends. Cheryl deduces that Larry likes big rear ends. This is when Wanda drops by, and Larry's comments lead Wanda and Cheryl to believe that Larry has some kind of rear end fetish.Cheryl receives a traffic violation in the mail which contains a photo of the time of the incident. Larry is staring at Jeff's mom's rear end as she was leaning over the front seats. Her suspicions are confirmed."

Larry calls Richard Lewis (Richard Lewis), who is going to the movie with his date & won't invite Larry to join them.

    "full_text": "Larry cleans his glasses with his assistant's shirt while she is wearing it causing her to become uncomfortable and accuse him of sexual harassment. Larry and Leon go to Mocha Joe's and Larry complains about a wobbly table, cold coffee, and the softness of the scones. Larry is then banned from the coffee shop. At a dinner party at Jeff and Susie's, Jeff is commonly mistaken for Harvey Weinstein by various women and receives dirty looks. Larry accidentally touches a server's breast when trying to grab food from the tray. With Ted Danson out of town, Larry offers to drive Cheryl home, and they kiss in the car and end up having sex together in bed. After getting the idea from Jeff, Larry wears a Make America Great Again hat to get out of having lunch with Philip Rosenthal, believing that if he is seen as a Trump supporter, good people will want nothing to do with him.[38] The server from the dinner party calls Larry's office and talks with his assistant Alice about the incident. In an act of spite, Larry leases the location next to Mocha Joe's, and tells Joe that he will be opening a coffee shop as well. It will be called Latte Larry's and everything will be cheaper. Cheryl has an allergic reaction to Larry's talcum powder while having sex and winds up in the hospital. Susie figures out their secret and Larry bolts from the hospital when he learns Ted has returned."
