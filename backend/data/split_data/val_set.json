Cheryl (Cheryl Hines) is angry with Larry for picking up the phone during sex. He wants to go to the Hebrew temple but needs tickets months in advance. Jeff (Jeff Garlin) advises Larry to get scalper tickets.Jeff tells Larry that a local deli has named a sandwich after him. But the sandwich sounds very unappetizing. While Larry's dad Nat (Shelley Berman) is proud of him as Larry has a sandwich named after him at the local Deli. Larry speaks to the Deli owner Leo (Ed O'Ross), to see if he could assign a different sandwich to him. Leo advises Larry to see if another sandwich name owner would like to switch sandwiches with Larry (Larry wants to switch it with Ted Danson). Larry complains to his dad about Leo shaking his hand too tightly. Then his dad has a stroke inside the Deli and has to be taken to the hospital. Larry takes a lot of cash counter candy with him before leaving. Leo notices Larry taking too many cash counter candy with him. Larry speaks to Ted Danson, who agrees to switch, but is revolted to hear of the ingredients of Larry's sandwich. He refuses to switch.The doctor tells Larry that the sandwich could have caused the stroke. On the hospital bed, Larry's dad tells him that Larry is adopted. The doctor, the head of the department, is a big fan of Seinfeld & offers Larry to perform Larry's dad's surgery with his own hands. The doctor is the Chief Surgeon at the hospital and is not required to do hands on surgery. SO, this is a big favor he is doing for Larry.

    "full_text": "Larry (Larry David) is changed by a near-death experience. He nearly drowns while swimming & survives. He thinks this was all because of a reason. Cheryl (Cheryl Hines) is angry with Larry for picking up the phone during sex. He wants to go to the Hebrew temple but needs tickets months in advance. Jeff (Jeff Garlin) advises Larry to get scalper tickets.Jeff tells Larry that a local deli has named a sandwich after him. But the sandwich sounds very unappetizing. While Larry's dad Nat (Shelley Berman) is proud of him as Larry has a sandwich named after him at the local Deli. Larry speaks to the Deli owner Leo (Ed O'Ross), to see if he could assign a different sandwich to him. Leo advises Larry to see if another sandwich name owner would like to switch sandwiches with Larry (Larry wants to switch it with Ted Danson).

Larry takes a lot of cash counter candy with him before leaving. Leo notices Larry taking too many cash counter candy with him. Larry speaks to Ted Danson, who agrees to switch, but is revolted to hear of the ingredients of Larry's sandwich. He refuses to switch.The doctor tells Larry that the sandwich could have caused the stroke. On the hospital bed, Larry's dad tells him that Larry is adopted. The doctor, the head of the department, is a big fan of Seinfeld & offers Larry to perform Larry's dad's surgery with his own hands.

The guy needs $250K as seed money to develop his product.Larry and Jeff are convinced when they see that the inventor is good looking, and his wife Gabby (Aida Turturro) is a total loser. So, they think the inventor has character and can be trusted with their money. They install the prototype on their car and are immediately impressed when the device helps them avoid a traffic jam. Larry meets Wanda (Wanda Sykes) in NYC and suggests his personal trainer Terry (Cheyenne Jackson) who has been great for Larry's pains and niggles.Larry, Jeff & Susie go to a party at their common friend Henry's (Grant Shaud) apartment. Henry tells them that his father was Judge Horn (George Bartenieff), a popular TV show judge back in the day. Henry says that his dad lives with him now. Larry goes back to see him and says hi and finds a one-armed man playing scrabble with him. When Larry comes in, the guy goes away, and Larry starts playing with Henry's dad. Even before the first move, Henry comes in to find his dad agitated and score of 217 to 65. Henry accuses Larry of cheating at scrabble with his dad. Henry asks Larry to leave.Using the car periscope, Larry and Jeff track down the one-armed man in the streets of NYC, but he escapes down the subway. Terry starts blowing off Larry and doesn't show up for their appointments. Larry meets his financial advisor who advises against investing in the car periscope. Larry sees that his wife is absolutely gorgeous and decides that he can't trust him. Larry fires his financial advisor and he & Jeff hand over $250K to the inventor of car periscope.At that lunch, Larry sees Henry entering the restaurant and intentionally cozies up to Gabby and makes sure that Henry notices. Henry walks up to Larry later and says that he misjudged Larry and that clearly, he is a man of great character. Henry asks Larry to take his father to the park for a game of scrabble. There Larry learns that Judge Horn is a closet racist. At the park Larry finds Terry training with Wanda and finds that Wanda paid Terry more to dump Larry. Larry convinces Wanda to let Judge Horn decide, knowing fully well that Horn hates colored people. Terry is back with Larry.That night Larry goes to the movies with the inventor and Gabby. Gabby is fat and gobbles food, so Larry reluctant to hand over his popcorn to her when he goes to the bathroom.

Larry complains that Marty didn't call to thank him for the condolence message he left, and also that he'll never get the $50 owed him because you can't ask a mourner to pay his debt. Susie comes in and gets into an argument with Larry over who owes who a condolence for Ida's death. To break things up, Jeff suggests he and Larry go to the ice cream store.Waiting their turn in the ice cream line, Larry decides to buy some for Cheryl, explaining it's part of his strategy to get sex. With the line taking forever, Larry grows impatient with the sample abuser ahead of them. Jeff decides he shouldn't be eating ice cream and leaves Larry, who confronts the sample abuser, and she finally storms out. Leaving the store, Larry bumps into Marty Funkhouser who is out for a jog to work out some of his pent-up emotions. When Larry mentions he didn't receive a thank you for his condolence, Marty protests that he was preoccupied - he's an orphan now. Marty remembers that he owes Larry money and pulls out a soggy $50 bill from his running shoe. Larry is disgusted and tries to refuse it, but Marty says it's the only money he has, take it or leave it. Larry takes it, grudgingly.When Larry returns home with ice cream for Cheryl, Loretta is upset he didn't buy any for her family. Larry feels this is an honest mistake on his part - a sin of omission. Cheryl isn't impressed with his offering because she's just gotten a call from the private school, they're trying to get Daryl and Keisha into, and it turns out the woman Larry argued with at the ice cream shop is the dean of admissions. Larry insists he was in the right - she was breaking the rules of society. He promises he'll make things right - he'll get her flowers. When the painter presents Larry with a bill for $50, Larry offers him the Funkhouser fifty. Disgusted, the painter refuses it, settling for the crumpled bills and change Larry offers instead.When Larry tries to pay for a bouquet of flowers with the Funkhouser fifty, the salesperson refuses it. He calls Marty from his car to complain that no one will take his fifty and demands that Marty bring a replacement to his house. Hanging up, Larry spots the Ida Funkhouser roadside memorial and pulls over. Looking around, he grabs a bouquet of flowers and heads off to the private school. Dean Julia Thorpe accepts Larry's apology and is pleased with the flowers, which she has her assistant put in a vase on her desk.On his way home, he stops by the Ida Funkhouser roadside memorial again and picks up a bouquet for Cheryl and one for Loretta. The women are happy for the flowers and Cheryl is impressed that he was able to get back into the Dean's good graces. Larry is feeling like he might get lucky with Cheryl. But then Marty shows up and recognizes the flowers and demands their return. Larry promises to retrieve the bunch he gave to the Dean. Begging Cheryl for some way to get back on her good side, she suggests a bottle of her favorite perfume might do the trick.Waiting online at the perfume store, Larry grows anxious and tries to second guess which line will move faster, switching back and forth with another man. But the woman in front of him hold things up when she tries different samples, and the man who'd been behind him, moves to the front of the other line and snags the last bottle of Cheryl's favorite perfume. Enraged, Larry causes a scene in the store. He heads back to the school, where Jeff and Susie are meeting with the Dean about Sammi's application. Larry snatches the flowers but can't get out the door before they spot him. Quickly, he stuffs the flowers in an open handbag.

He is even more suspicious when Cynthia cannot fully detail her suicide attempt, upsetting Richard for interfering in his life. Larry and his lawyer, Sibby Sanders (Sanaa Lathan) arrive at the trial, with some protesters supporting him outside, one of whom is Ted Danson. At the trial, District Attorney Earl Mack (Greg Kinnear) points Larry as a danger to society for his actions, while Sibby uses her testimony to challenge the Election Integrity Act of 2021. During her testimony, Larry is annoyed by a fly and kills it in front of the jurors. Mack calls many character witnesses to testify. The first is Mocha Joe (Saverio Guerra), who brings up the time Larry insulted him and opened a spite store next to his business, also accusing him of burning it down.[a] The next witness is Matsue Takahashi (Dana Lee), who relates how Larry hit Troy Kotsur with a golfball,[b] and also killed Kyoko, Takahashi's black swan.[c] The next witness is Alexander Vindman, who accuses Larry of bribing a councilwoman.[d] That night, Larry and Jeff manage to obtain the secret recipe for a salad dressing from Auntie Rae (Ellia English), which Jeff gives to Susie for their anniversary. As he discusses the case with his friends, Larry receives advice from Leon; he must draw compassion from the jury to win them over. The following day, Susie enters the court room as a wheelchair-bound lover of Larry, with Larry faking good deeds to improve his image. Mack then brings Rachel Heinemann (Iris Bahr), who relates how Larry forced her to jump off a ski lift due to her strict observance of her Orthodox Judaism.[e] Another witness is Maureen (Jillian Bell), who states Larry urinated on her portrait of Jesus.[f] More include the maitre'd from Katsuya (Sonny Saito), who complains over Larry yelling as a greeting to two chefs;[g] Irma (Tracey Ullman), who reveals that Larry stole a pair of shoes from an exhibit at the Holocaust Museum LA;[h] Bruce Springsteen, who accuses Larry of ruining his tour by giving him COVID-19;[i] and Tara Michaelson (Bailey Thompson), who claims that Larry had an erection while she hugged him as a child.[j] Sibby summons Rae to support Larry, but she angrily goes on a tirade by calling Larry and Jeff out for stealing her recipe. Realizing this is where her gift came from, Susie ends the charade and walks out of the room. The case is withheld until the following day, but Larry is losing support. At a bar, Larry runs into Jerry Seinfeld. The following day, Larry testifies, and acts compassionate by claiming he just wanted to help Rae as there was nothing to cover her from the sun. Mack then questions Larry, asking him to remember many of his misdeeds; such as stealing flowers from a roadside memorial for Ida Funkhouser;[k] taking a 5-wood golf club from Leo Funkhouser's hand at his funeral;[l] breaking into head councilman Weinblatt's house to retrieve an incriminating letter;[m] and the 'beloved cunt' typo in Louise's obituary.[n] Mack mentions more of Larry's misdeeds to the jury which includes refusing to give candy to two trick-or-treating girls on Halloween because they are not wearing costumes;[o] exhuming the corpse of his mother Adele;[p] inviting Rick, the convicted sex offender, to a Passover Seder;[q] eating Oscar's last meal which was ice cream;[r] having sex with a blow up doll in front of Cheryl;[s] teaching Greg how to knit a swastika pillow sham for Susie;[t] hiring a prostitute named Monena as his passenger;[u] and lying over being abused by his uncle Leo at an incest survivors group.[v] Mack uses all of this to point that the Act is required to prevent society from ending due to people like Larry. Finally, the jury reaches a verdict: Larry is declared guilty. Judge Whittaker (Dean Norris) notes how Larry kept committing mistakes, telling him he hopes he finally learned a lesson, and sentences him to one year in prison. While sitting in his cell, Larry converses with an inmate (Tarnue Massaquoi) over the appearance of an erection caused by the fabric of his pants bunching up, referred to as a 'pants tent', which was referenced in (and gave its name to) the first episode of the series. Suddenly, Seinfeld shows up, telling Larry that he met one of the jurors (Martin Carlin) at a Mexican restaurant the previous night. This violated the jury sequestration, causing a mistrial and Larry is allowed to be released. As he walks off, Larry tells Seinfeld, 'this is how we should've ended the finale', and both express disappointment for not coming up with it before.

Arriving in Atlanta, Larry is blocked from entering an exit by a woman on Interstate 85.
