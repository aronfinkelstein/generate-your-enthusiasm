Cheryl would love to, but she wants to talk to her therapist Dr. Slavin (Winnie Holzman) first.Larry talks to his therapist, Dr. Bright (Steve Coogan), about how well the date went with Cheryl. Dr. Bright coaches Larry on exactly what to do on his movie/dinner date with Cheryl so as not to come off as weak and desperate. During their movie/dinner date, Marty and Nan Funkhouser (Ann Ryerson) run into Cheryl and Larry at the restaurant and Marty asks Larry to sponsor him for a 5-mile Walkathon to benefit Alzheimer's, which he's doing in honor of Nan's father. Larry starts to protest but when Cheryl says it's a good cause, he makes the pledge - once again impressing Cheryl with New Larry. He asks her to move back in and she's touched, but when he gives her a Monday deadline she storms out. Larry chases after her shouting that his therapist told him to give her the ultimatum, but she doesn't believe him.Larry storms into Dr. Bright's office screaming at him for the ultimatum advice. He drags Dr. Bright to Cheryl's to set things straight. Larry is impressed with Cheryl's new place on the beach. She explains that her therapist recommended it.

Dr. Bright says this isn't his top priority at the moment. He is very upset with his accommodations. Larry promises he'll get him out but has to cut their session short because he needs to talk to Cheryl who is getting out of therapy. But when he calls Cheryl, she says her therapist told her not to talk to Larry ever again. Larry finds Jeff taking part in the Alzheimer's Walkathon to report this news. Jeff says it makes no sense. Larry realizes Dr. Slavin must like him, she wants him for herself. Jeff says Larry is done for.They pass Marty Funkhouser who's sitting in a cafe along the walk route.

Andy was playing aggressively with the kids and this irked Larry, who in turn plays aggressively with Andy. He breaks Andy's thumbs when he throws the ball really hard at him.The investors of the restaurant want Larry to apologize to Andy, which he agrees to. Andy cannot review the restaurant as he can't do his thumbs up or thumbs down gig on TV.

As a thank you, Larry insists on feeding Andy's lunch to him, as his hands are bandaged. Larry only ends up spilling the entire lunch on Andy's clothes.When the investors find out about the new chef's disability, they think Andy did this on purpose to extract revenge on Larry.

After lunch the stranger confronts Larry about his missing laptop and Larry says he asked a colored guy to look after it. The stranger is taken aback as he does not want to insinuate that a colored guy stole his laptop, just because he was colored.Back at home, the matron, named Margaret (Miriam Flynn), of a nearby battered women safe house comes by and asks Larry to apologize to the dog walker, who is a member of her safe house. Margaret convinces Larry by saying that he would be the male representative for the entire species, and would set a positive male role model for the battered women to look up to.

But while exiting, the lady parking attendant confronts Larry & even though Larry tells her that he gave her male colleague $10, she makes him pay $20 (his last $20).Now at the exit, Larry is again out of money, and asks the male attendant for his $10 back. The guy refuses, and Larry has to borrow $3 from his recently sacked Lawyer to exit the parking. He is again 30 mins late for the next meeting with Diane. As Larry is waiting, he again runs into his interior designer, who fights Larry for firing her & wants him to pay her regardless.

Larry is trying to find a way to apologize to the Ayatollah and to get his life back on track. Jeff says that even the FBI says that nobody is coming for him. Jeff and Leon force Larry to return home. Larry argues with the hotel concierge about their policy regarding using tongs to pick up the free cookies in the lobby. Larry complains that tongs are not used for picking up a cookie. He also says that the so called \"fresh\" cookies are from a canned tin.Marty Funkhouser (Bob Einstein) brings his nephew Kenny (Niall Cunningham), an All-American pitcher, to Larry's house and Kenny ends up breaking his elbow (on his pitching arm) when trying to open a pickle jar. This prevents him from masturbating, which causes him to behave very badly from the frustration. Larry suggests they a hire a prostitute for him, Paula (Bianca Kajlich), someone Larry recently met at the hotel, and to whom he gave unexpectedly helpful advice about toning down her attire. Larry had suggested not to dress like a prostitute and suggests that a nice dress will improve her earnings.Larry realizes that he left his Pajama bottoms at the hotel. Larry is jumpy all the time and asks Leon to arrange security for him. Ted Danson, who has recently divorced his wife Mary Steenburgen, asks for Larry's permission to date Cheryl. Larry says no. Larry says he wants to date Mary. Mary turns Larry down. Ted decides to go ahead with Cheryl regardless. Larry tells Ted that Cheryl does not give BJs. Larry goes back to the hotel to pick up his pajama bottoms, which he left in his room. He again picks a cookie with his hands and again has a huge argument with the hotel concierge and is asked not to return to the hotel.Leon hires a security guard for Larry, who is scared for his life and can't sleep or be comfortable in his own house. The security guard is a colored person and is high maintenance and gives Larry a list of items for shopping. He needs soft towels, antioxidants, fruit, and so on.Since Larry is not allowed in the hotel, he asks Leon to create a diversion by trying to open a pickle jar in the lobby. His theory is everyone wants to be a pickle jar hero. As the gambit works, Larry sneaks in and meets Paula and asks her for a favor and have sex with Kenny. In the hotel, Larry finds Cheryl with Ted. Then he also sees Mary going out with a guy just like him, after she had told Larry that he was not her physical type.Larry gets help from one of his old lovers, Shara (Anne Bedian) (The Palestinian girl from Al Abbas, the chicken place), who puts him in touch with the Consul of Iran, but things go awry. The consul wants a video call. As Paula has sex with Kenny, Larry talks to Marty and finds that Marty has been going out with Cheryl behind his back. Larry takes the video call with the Consul from Marty's house. while having the video call, Kenny comes loudly and the security guard thinks Larry is screaming and pulls Paula off Kenny and she runs around the house in her underwear, for the consul to see. The consul is offended and cuts the call.",

    "full_text": "Larry, having assumed the alias \"Buck Dancer\" and wearing a disguise (a wig and a mustache) in public, returns home after living in a hotel due to the fear of the Fatwa. Larry is trying to find a way to apologize to the Ayatollah and to get his life back on track. Jeff says that even the FBI says that nobody is coming for him. Jeff and Leon force Larry to return home. Larry argues with the hotel concierge about their policy regarding using tongs to pick up the free cookies in the lobby. Larry complains that tongs are not used for picking up a cookie. He also says that the so called \"fresh\" cookies are from a canned tin.Marty Funkhouser (Bob Einstein) brings his nephew Kenny (Niall Cunningham), an All-American pitcher, to Larry's house and Kenny ends up breaking his elbow (on his pitching arm) when trying to open a pickle jar. This prevents him from masturbating, which causes him to behave very badly from the frustration. Larry suggests they a hire a prostitute for him, Paula (Bianca Kajlich), someone Larry recently met at the hotel, and to whom he gave unexpectedly helpful advice about toning down her attire. Larry had suggested not to dress like a prostitute and suggests that a nice dress will improve her earnings.Larry realizes that he left his Pajama bottoms at the hotel. Larry is jumpy all the time and asks Leon to arrange security for him. Ted Danson, who has recently divorced his wife Mary Steenburgen, asks for Larry's permission to date Cheryl. Larry says no. Larry says he wants to date Mary. Mary turns Larry down. Ted decides to go ahead with Cheryl regardless. Larry tells Ted that Cheryl does not give BJs. Larry goes back to the hotel to pick up his pajama bottoms, which he left in his room. He again picks a cookie with his hands and again has a huge argument with the hotel concierge and is asked not to return to the hotel.Leon hires a security guard for Larry, who is scared for his life and can't sleep or be comfortable in his own house. The security guard is a colored person and is high maintenance and gives Larry a list of items for shopping. He needs soft towels, antioxidants, fruit, and so on.Since Larry is not allowed in the hotel, he asks Leon to create a diversion by trying to open a pickle jar in the lobby. His theory is everyone wants to be a pickle jar hero. As the gambit works, Larry sneaks in and meets Paula and asks her for a favor and have sex with Kenny. In the hotel, Larry finds Cheryl with Ted. Then he also sees Mary going out with a guy just like him, after she had told Larry that he was not her physical type.Larry gets help from one of his old lovers, Shara (Anne Bedian) (The Palestinian girl from Al Abbas, the chicken place), who puts him in touch with the Consul of Iran, but things go awry. The consul wants a video call. As Paula has sex with Kenny, Larry talks to Marty and finds that Marty has been going out with Cheryl behind his back. Larry takes the video call with the Consul from Marty's house. while having the video call, Kenny comes loudly and the security guard thinks Larry is screaming and pulls Paula off Kenny and she runs around the house in her underwear, for the consul to see. The consul is offended and cuts the call."

Larry badgers him but Ted won't give in, so Larry changes course and asks that he be able to invite his driver inside to the party so he doesn't have to wait alone in the car. Ted would rather send coffee out, but finally acquiesces. Later, opening his gifts, Ted is unimpressed with the Freak Book, and Larry snatches it away to show Jeff. As the two of them laugh loudly over the photos, Charlie the driver stumbles into the room, plastered. When Mary runs in, shouting that Charlie groped her, Ted kicks him out, and throws Larry and his Freak Book out after him.With Charlie too drunk to drive, Larry and Cheryl drive him home to a depressing house where his wheelchair-bound wife greets them screaming at the door -- with her aging father shouting in the background. Larry is disturbed by their sad lives but begs to borrow the limo until the next day so he and Cheryl can get home.The next night, getting ready to go to the Paul McCartney concert, Larry tells Cheryl he no longer wants to be buried next to Ted after he kicked him out last night, and insists that she swap places with him. Cheryl is amenable, but warns he must clear it with Susie, who Larry will be next to if they switch. When Jeff and Susie arrive to go to the concert with them, Larry kisses up to Susie. But when he raises a toast to friendship and announces he's trading places with Cheryl, Susie balks. Furious no one will switch places, Larry storms out, taking the limo: \"If you don't want to be buried next to me when you're dead, I can assume you don't want to be next to me when you're alive!\"In the limo, Larry gets a call from a hungover Charlie who needs a big favor. He's late to pick up at VIP client at the airport and needs Larry to cover for him. Larry resists but Charlie wears him down. It turns out the VIP Is John McEnroe who is headed to the McCartney concert. As he drives, Larry won't stop talking, firing away questions about being shy, ping pong, gardening and the frequency of married sex, much to McEnroe's dismay.Driving by the cemetery, Larry insists on making a stop for just couple of minutes. He urges McEnroe to read the Freak Book (which Larry left in the limo) while he waits. Larry ends up purchasing a second plot, away from his group; he'll have to sell his plot himself; they don't take returns.Impatient, McEnroe gets out to look for Larry and an Italian family climb into the limo, thinking it's theirs. When Larry returns, he can't get the grieving family out of the limo. The family insists he drive them home and Larry orders McEnroe into the back with them. When Larry gets lost and the mayhem in the limo escalates, a fed-up McEnroe insists Larry pull over and ejects the family. They continue on to the concert and Larry talks McEnroe into taking him to the VIP pre-party - along with the Freak Book, which McEnroe loves.At the pre-party, as Larry and McEnroe get drunk their enthusiasm for the Freak Book gets louder and the crowd quiets just in time to hear them shouting \"What a freak!\" the moment Heather Mills enters. The two are ejected from the party just as the Greens and Cheryl drive by.

    "text": "On the way to the bathroom at work, Larry sees Cha Cha, who is seated at a desk just outside the Men's room. She thanks Larry for his help in getting her the new job, just as her boss Bart, a producer, greets Larry and confirms they're on for lunch with the wives. Cha Cha keeps chatting, but Larry manages to duck into the bathroom. When he exits, she comments: \"That was quick.\"Before lunch, Jeff stops by and Larry complains that Cha Cha is like a bathroom monitor. When Jeff asks why Larry doesn't just go at home, he explains that Cheryl uses environmental toilet paper, and he can't abide it. At the end of lunch with Larry, Cheryl, Jeff, Susie, Bart and his wife Barbara (Isabella Hofmann), Larry jokes with Bart that he can fire Cha Cha, it would be fine with him. Cheryl changes the subject, praising Barbara for attending lunch when they have nine children. Everyone is impressed except Larry, who finds it a little egotistical. Bart mentions his father has opened a retro barber shop and Larry and Jeff vow to try it. When the officious waiter Daviday (Taylor Negron) comes to ask how everything was, Susie announces she'd like a doggie bag. When Daviday discerns that she is going to feed the food to her dog, he informs her that it is not the restaurant's policy to allow that. As their argument escalates, Larry intervenes by asking to take the food home himself. Daviday demands to know if Larry intends to eat the leftover steak himself. When Larry promises he will, Daviday intones, \"We shall see.\"Richard stops by to see Larry and suggests a double date with Cheryl and Cha Cha to see a movie. Larry says he'll have to check with Cheryl and confesses to Richard that Cha Cha isn't really working out, she's too chatty. Richard notes that she's told him Larry goes to the bathroom 10-14 times/day and they are both concerned. Larry loses his temper, accusing her of having bowel concern. Defending his bathroom habits, Larry challenges Richard to a colon contest. Fleeing their argument, Larry retreats to the bathroom. When he flushes, the sound -- like a sonic boom -- sends him reeling, and to the doctor for his ear.During his exam, the doctor asks Larry a series of questions and when he gets to the question of whether he's urinating a lot, Larry gets defensive. He resists answering. Exasperated, the doctor recommends that Larry \"stay off the right ear\" and talk to a therapist about his bathroom issues. Larry demands to see another physician but is told he'll have to make another appointment to see someone else. As Larry leaves, a skinhead in the waiting room growls at him: \"What the f**k you looking at?\" and calls him a \"f**king faggot\".When Larry gets home, he is greeted by the Blacks who are upset about the toilet paper situation being like Port Authority toilet paper. Larry offers to get them soft toilet paper if they allow him access to their bathroom and swears them to secrecy. He then pulls Leon aside and tells him about the skinhead incident. Leon tells him in those situations he needs to \"get in that a**.\".Larry calls Richard to confirm their double date and Cha Cha answers. She suggests they go to a fancy restaurant, and he agrees to tell Cheryl. Struggling to talk lefty, Larry has to keep pulling the phone away from his ear. He asks Cha Cha what she's wearing. Confused, she asks if he means right now. But Larry has pulled the phone away from his ear and doesn't hear her. He starts to breathe heavily with the frustration of talking lefty and asks again what she's wearing. Disgusted, Cha Cha hangs up.Larry is enjoying his old-fashioned haircut at the barber shop and chats with Bart's father. When the barber asks if everything seemed OK with Bart, because Barbara just had a miscarriage, Larry brushes it off: \"They already have nine kids.\" Upset, the barber tells Larry he's done and whips him mercilessly with his towel, sending Larry and Jeff running.When Larry drops Jeff at home, Susie yells that the dog has been shitting all day after being fed the food from the restaurant. She's certain Daviday must have tainted it and demands that Jeff confront him. But Larry reminds them he promised he'd eat the food. Even better, according to Susie.

    "full_text": "On the way to the bathroom at work, Larry sees Cha Cha, who is seated at a desk just outside the Men's room. She thanks Larry for his help in getting her the new job, just as her boss Bart, a producer, greets Larry and confirms they're on for lunch with the wives. Cha Cha keeps chatting, but Larry manages to duck into the bathroom. When he exits, she comments: \"That was quick.\"Before lunch, Jeff stops by and Larry complains that Cha Cha is like a bathroom monitor. When Jeff asks why Larry doesn't just go at home, he explains that Cheryl uses environmental toilet paper, and he can't abide it. At the end of lunch with Larry, Cheryl, Jeff, Susie, Bart and his wife Barbara (Isabella Hofmann), Larry jokes with Bart that he can fire Cha Cha, it would be fine with him. Cheryl changes the subject, praising Barbara for attending lunch when they have nine children. Everyone is impressed except Larry, who finds it a little egotistical. Bart mentions his father has opened a retro barber shop and Larry and Jeff vow to try it. When the officious waiter Daviday (Taylor Negron) comes to ask how everything was, Susie announces she'd like a doggie bag. When Daviday discerns that she is going to feed the food to her dog, he informs her that it is not the restaurant's policy to allow that. As their argument escalates, Larry intervenes by asking to take the food home himself. Daviday demands to know if Larry intends to eat the leftover steak himself. When Larry promises he will, Daviday intones, \"We shall see.\"Richard stops by to see Larry and suggests a double date with Cheryl and Cha Cha to see a movie. Larry says he'll have to check with Cheryl and confesses to Richard that Cha Cha isn't really working out, she's too chatty. Richard notes that she's told him Larry goes to the bathroom 10-14 times/day and they are both concerned. Larry loses his temper, accusing her of having bowel concern. Defending his bathroom habits, Larry challenges Richard to a colon contest. Fleeing their argument, Larry retreats to the bathroom. When he flushes, the sound -- like a sonic boom -- sends him reeling, and to the doctor for his ear.During his exam, the doctor asks Larry a series of questions and when he gets to the question of whether he's urinating a lot, Larry gets defensive. He resists answering. Exasperated, the doctor recommends that Larry \"stay off the right ear\" and talk to a therapist about his bathroom issues. Larry demands to see another physician but is told he'll have to make another appointment to see someone else. As Larry leaves, a skinhead in the waiting room growls at him: \"What the f**k you looking at?\" and calls him a \"f**king faggot\".When Larry gets home, he is greeted by the Blacks who are upset about the toilet paper situation being like Port Authority toilet paper. Larry offers to get them soft toilet paper if they allow him access to their bathroom and swears them to secrecy. He then pulls Leon aside and tells him about the skinhead incident. Leon tells him in those situations he needs to \"get in that a**.\".Larry calls Richard to confirm their double date and Cha Cha answers. She suggests they go to a fancy restaurant, and he agrees to tell Cheryl. Struggling to talk lefty, Larry has to keep pulling the phone away from his ear. He asks Cha Cha what she's wearing. Confused, she asks if he means right now. But Larry has pulled the phone away from his ear and doesn't hear her. He starts to breathe heavily with the frustration of talking lefty and asks again what she's wearing. Disgusted, Cha Cha hangs up.Larry is enjoying his old-fashioned haircut at the barber shop and chats with Bart's father. When the barber asks if everything seemed OK with Bart, because Barbara just had a miscarriage, Larry brushes it off: \"They already have nine kids.\" Upset, the barber tells Larry he's done and whips him mercilessly with his towel, sending Larry and Jeff running.When Larry drops Jeff at home, Susie yells that the dog has been shitting all day after being fed the food from the restaurant. She's certain Daviday must have tainted it and demands that Jeff confront him. But Larry reminds them he promised he'd eat the food. Even better, according to Susie. Larry has to tell Daviday he's been sick as a dog since eating the food. When Larry confronts Daviday for tampering with the food, the waiter is skeptical of Larry's claim he ate it, and they stare each other down.Larry returns home to use the bathroom in the Black's guest room.

Larry shows him the swastika and tells him about Hitler and the Hebrews. Greg says his Birthday is coming up and he wants a Swastika as a gift. Larry and his girlfriend go to a bar where his girlfriend plays background music on the piano, and nobody pays attention. Michael J Fox walks in and ignores Larry's pleas to be quiet. Larry's girlfriend does not realize that Greg has latent homosexual tendencies.In a lift, Larry has a fight with a fellow occupant when he accidentally presses 2 floor buttons as the other guy was in a rush. Larry meets Michael and asks if he is angry that Larry shushed him at the bar. At the bar, Michael shook his head at Larry, and he noticed it. Michael says that he has Parkinson's and that his head shakes involuntarily but doesn't clarify if he is angry or not.Larry draws a Hitler mustache on a person on the cover of a magazine and Michael chides him that the man is his father-in-law. He throws the mag in garbage. Larry gets Greg a sewing machine for his birthday and Greg is thrilled. But his girlfriend is upset that Larry is trying to turn her son gay. Larry informs her that he already might be gay.Larry lives directly below Michael J's apartment and he and Leon are constantly woken by clumping sounds at night and throughout the day. Leon says that a fight between an old man and a Parkinson's patient is a fair game. Larry confronts Michael that he is using Parkinson's to trouble Larry. Michael insists that it is indeed Parkinson's. The clumping sounds are due to his special shoes that he has to wear due to his condition.Susie tells Larry to get another gift for Greg. Susie says that Larry cannot assume that Greg will turn out to be gay. Greg is too young to be classified that way yet. Michael bumps into Larry on the way out of his building and Larry says that it on purpose. Nobody believes him that Michael is harassing him. Larry goes to the building board with his complaint. The board instead chides Larry on the lift incident and the altercation with Michael J Fox and says that a 3rd incident would mean he is out of the building. The board asks Larry to donate $10K to Michael J Fox's Parkinson's foundation.Larry gets Greg another gift, a violin, but he loves his sewing machine and has made Susie a gift.

    "full_text": "Larry picks his girlfriend from her apartment and meets her young son Greg (Eddie Schweighardt), who is into fashion and acts partly gay. Larry shows him the swastika and tells him about Hitler and the Hebrews. Greg says his Birthday is coming up and he wants a Swastika as a gift. Larry and his girlfriend go to a bar where his girlfriend plays background music on the piano, and nobody pays attention. Michael J Fox walks in and ignores Larry's pleas to be quiet. Larry's girlfriend does not realize that Greg has latent homosexual tendencies.In a lift, Larry has a fight with a fellow occupant when he accidentally presses 2 floor buttons as the other guy was in a rush. Larry meets Michael and asks if he is angry that Larry shushed him at the bar. At the bar, Michael shook his head at Larry, and he noticed it. Michael says that he has Parkinson's and that his head shakes involuntarily but doesn't clarify if he is angry or not.Larry draws a Hitler mustache on a person on the cover of a magazine and Michael chides him that the man is his father-in-law. He throws the mag in garbage. Larry gets Greg a sewing machine for his birthday and Greg is thrilled. But his girlfriend is upset that Larry is trying to turn her son gay. Larry informs her that he already might be gay.Larry lives directly below Michael J's apartment and he and Leon are constantly woken by clumping sounds at night and throughout the day. Leon says that a fight between an old man and a Parkinson's patient is a fair game. Larry confronts Michael that he is using Parkinson's to trouble Larry. Michael insists that it is indeed Parkinson's. The clumping sounds are due to his special shoes that he has to wear due to his condition.Susie tells Larry to get another gift for Greg. Susie says that Larry cannot assume that Greg will turn out to be gay. Greg is too young to be classified that way yet. Michael bumps into Larry on the way out of his building and Larry says that it on purpose. Nobody believes him that Michael is harassing him. Larry goes to the building board with his complaint. The board instead chides Larry on the lift incident and the altercation with Michael J Fox and says that a 3rd incident would mean he is out of the building. The board asks Larry to donate $10K to Michael J Fox's Parkinson's foundation.Larry gets Greg another gift, a violin, but he loves his sewing machine and has made Susie a gift.

The two men go to Larry's bedside and take a tough love approach to coaxing him out of being so mope. Larry insists he can't imagine himself with anyone other than Cheryl and when Jeff tells him Cheryl is coming to Sammi's Bat Mitzvah. Larry gets more upset.Leon drags Larry downstairs to talk to the rest of the Blacks, who urge him to forget about Cheryl and Larry finally vows to do so. The Blacks then announce that they are moving out; their house rehab is finished. Daryl comes running out, upset that his gerbil has escaped, and they all disperse to look for it.At work, Larry's assistant Antoinette Spolar announces that someone is coming to look at renting the office across the hall, which upsets Larry, who likes having it empty. She also tells him Matt Tessler (Michael McKean), who was a 'Seinfeld' director, called to say he's stopping by. Larry groans and guesses it's because Matt wants him to put in a good word for him to direct Richard Lewis's pilot. Larry thinks Matt is a terrible director. He and Antoinette discuss that Matt has a son with some sort of disability. Matt drops in and, sure enough, tells Larry he's been stuck in the Dramedy ghetto and would like his help with Lewis's pilot. Cornered, Larry agrees to recommend him to Richard. Just then, Antoinette cuts in to ask if Larry still the tickle in his rear end, because she can't get him a doctor's appointment for a while. Larry is mortified and denies any tickle, but Matt insists he has a cousin who works for a top Gastroenterologist, and he can get him in right away.From his car phone, Larry calls Richard. He \"recommends\" Matt Tesler for the directing gig. At the Gastroenterologist's, Larry resists signing in, arguing with the receptionist that the sign-in sheet shouldn't be up on the counter for everyone to see. It should be private. She says she will take it up with the home office. In the waiting room, he flirts with another patient but is called into his appointment before he can get her name.Matt's cousin, the nurse, asks Larry why he wants to see the doctor, but Larry resists answering, arguing he should just tell the doctor directly. When she pushes him, he finally blurts \"I have a gerbil up my a**.\" Shocked, she notes the problem on his chart. When the doctor comes in and asks what the problem is, Larry looks at him with disbelief. Exiting the office, Larry sees the woman he was flirting with is gone. He tries to look at the sign-in sheet to get her name, but the receptionist reports that the home office loved his idea and it's now policy to keep the list private. She takes pity on Larry, though, and gives him the woman's name: Paula (Nadia Dajani).At lunch with Jeff, Larry reports he has a date with Paula, and they debate why she would have been at the Gastroenterologist's. Larry gets nervous about his date and asks Jeff and Susie to join them. Later, while the two couples wait in line at the movies, a retarded man makes his way loudly to the front of the line, cutting in front to buy his ticket. When they see him inside the theater, Larry points out to Paula that the man is not actually retarded; he faked it. During the film, both Larry and Paula squirm in their seats but when they ask each other what's wrong, neither one will admit to any discomfort.When Paula wants to leave the movie minutes before the end, Larry refuses to go with her. Paula leaves and Susie urges Larry to go after her. Larry is surprised Paula is gone when they emerge just 6 minutes later.The next day, when Larry sees a man looking at the office next door, Larry fakes being retarded, telling the man he's excited he'll be his neighbor and they have to go to lunch together every day. But Matt Tessler has stopped by to thank Larry for recommending him for Lewis's pilot (he got the job) and sees Larry's act. Tessler is offended, pointing out his ten-year-old mentally challenged son Max wouldn't find it funny. Matt reveals Larry's medical problem to everyone in his office.Larry meets Lewis, who is furious for Larry's recommendation because Tessler is ruining his pilot. Larry insists he'd put quotes around the recommendation. As they're arguing, Richard sees Larry squirm and says \"it's true, isn't it?\" He tells Larry the gerbil rumor is all over town and the Internet. Back at Larry's, the Blacks debate whether the gerbil rumor could be true. Larry denies it and they are all relieved. The kids announce they're all packed, and it hits Larry that they're really leaving. On a last-minute whim, he asks Loretta if she wants to go to the Bat Mitzvah with him and she does. At the Bat Mitzvah, Larry and a decked-out Loretta sit at a table with Richard and Cha Cha and the Funkhousers. Marty asks Larry about the gerbil, and he gets mad. When Jeff and Susie get up to welcome their guests and start the toasts, Larry insists on giving the first toast, but uses the opportunity to deny the gerbil rumor, much to the Greene's horror.During desert, Larry watches Cheryl with her No-Fly Zone date.

The audience, including Alice, assume it is because she is transgender and boos him. Alice now wants a personal monetary settlement as well. Before the meeting, Larry and Alice wait for the elevator and Larry offers Alice a scone, but it is too dry and Alice starts to choke. Larry begins to perform the Heimlich maneuver but hesitates because he does not know if it is appropriate to touch her, and she falls to the ground."

He reveals to his therapist Dr. Thurgood (Fred Melamed) the traumatic experience: when Larry was a boy, he was playing strip poker with a girl in her father's Mister Softee truck; when the father finds them, he ejects a naked Larry from the truck, causing people on the street to laugh at him. Later, during a softball championship game, the jingle causes Larry to make a costly error (similar to that of Bill Buckner's error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, where the ball rolls between his legs with the winning run coming to the plate that loses his team the game). He also loses his libido, affecting his relationship with his girlfriend Jennifer (Ana Gasteyer). As a result of his error, Larry's softball team captain and mechanic Yari (Robert Smigel) refuses to fix his car, causing the passenger seat to become unstable. For Jeff's birthday, Susie asks Larry to get a Mookie Wilson-autographed baseball at a card signing show.

    "full_text": "A jingle from Mister Softee trucks triggers traumatic memories for Larry. He reveals to his therapist Dr. Thurgood (Fred Melamed) the traumatic experience: when Larry was a boy, he was playing strip poker with a girl in her father's Mister Softee truck; when the father finds them, he ejects a naked Larry from the truck, causing people on the street to laugh at him. Later, during a softball championship game, the jingle causes Larry to make a costly error (similar to that of Bill Buckner's error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, where the ball rolls between his legs with the winning run coming to the plate that loses his team the game). He also loses his libido, affecting his relationship with his girlfriend Jennifer (Ana Gasteyer). As a result of his error, Larry's softball team captain and mechanic Yari (Robert Smigel) refuses to fix his car, causing the passenger seat to become unstable. For Jeff's birthday, Susie asks Larry to get a Mookie Wilson-autographed baseball at a card signing show. At the show, Larry runs into Dr. Thurgood and Bill Buckner, the latter of whom Larry asks for advice and befriends. However, Buckner loses the Wilson-autographed baseball after missing a throw from Larry. The unstable seat in Larry's car causes Jennifer (Ana Gasteyer) to have an orgasm.

At temple, Larry tells Freddy about what happened with Heidi. After the service, the rabbi gives Larry the shofar as a gift. Larry returns to the dry cleaners and discovers they have lost the robe (presumably on purpose). Larry visits Joe at his home and tells him he will replace the robe. Larry sees Joe lives on farmland with cows and asks him for a favor. Since Larry did Susie a favor, he asks her to sew a new robe, to which she eventually begrudgingly agrees. Larry takes Woody to Joe's farm pretending it to be his own. Upon leaving, Woody drops a grape on Joe's front porch and does not pick it up which causes an argument and Woody quits Larry's show. At lunch, Freddy questions Heidi about the incident and she storms off. At the optometrist, Heidi angrily confronts Larry and slams the phoropter against his eyes. Larry, with blurry vision again, rear-ends a woman with his car and learns her name is Mary Ferguson. Larry takes Mary to his house and they walk in on Leon and his friend eating watermelon, which she reacts to by leaving. At a rally, Joe puts on his new robe, sewn by Susie, but is attacked by other members when they see it has the Star of David sewn on the back. Joe angrily goes to Larry's at night to confront him, but Larry scares Joe away by blowing the shofar, causing the entire neighborhood to wake up."

A year later, the couple prepares to finalize their divorce, and Larry is happy with his apparently Jewish lawyer Andrew Berg (Paul F. Tompkins) negotiating for him to keep the large majority of his possessions, including his house. Larry's friend Joe O'Donnell (Gary Cole, a parody of Frank McCourt), owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is employing Berg to deal with his divorce. Larry tells O'Donnell he will buy boxes of Girl Scout Cookies from Joe's 13-year-old daughter Kiera (Kaitlyn Dever), but changes his mind when Joe reacts badly to Larry giving his daughter a tampon when she has her first period at Larry's house. Larry discovers that Berg is not Jewish and tells Joe; both men switch to being represented by Jewish lawyer Hiram Katz, whom Larry met in a restaurant. Three months later, Larry learns that Katz has given the Dodgers to O'Donnell's wife. He rushes to the office to stop the divorce paper signing, but is punched by O'Donnell en route; Cheryl receives the house as a result of the divorce settlement. Larry and Leon move to another house. Marty is going to London alone for three weeks. When Larry suggests to Marty's wife Nan that she join him for the trip, he is angry with Larry because he seeks to be away from Nan. The couple later decide to divorce, to Marty's joy."

Larry argues with the hotel concierge about their policy regarding using tongs to pick up the free cookies in the lobby. Marty brings his nephew Kenny, an All-American pitcher, to Larry's house and Kenny ends up breaking his elbow when trying to open a pickle jar.
