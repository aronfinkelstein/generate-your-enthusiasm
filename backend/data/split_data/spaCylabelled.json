When he hangs up, Leon notes they have the same cell phone.Cheryl calls out to Larry from bed. She's very sick and wants some attention. She tells him she can't go to Keysha's school production of 'Grease' and urges Larry to get someone to go in her place. Dropping the kids off at school, Larry runs into Susie who is talking to colored man named Hal (Tim Meadows) and his white, deaf wife, Jean (Deanne Bray). Susie translates Jean's sign language and Larry is impressed with her fluency. When Larry sees Jean's small dog in her bag, he says it looks \"half-rat,\" and Jean gets insulted and leaves. Larry tries to call out after her that she couldn't hear his tone, that he was joking, but it's too late. In the school restroom, he sees Hal and explains his joking tone about the rat dog comment. Hal suggests Larry stop by their house to make a face-to-face apology. As Larry dries his hands under the air dryer, he makes a gesture that apparently is insulting, and Hal storms out. At Jeff's, Larry explains his interest in sick sex. He also tells Jeff he's thinking of getting his father a happy ending massage and Jeff provides him with the name of a masseuse. When Susie comes in, Larry recreates the gesture he made to Hal and asks her to translate. \"You called Hal a c***sucker Larry!\" she informs him. Then, when Larry mentions he needs a date to see 'Grease' at the middle school, Mike (Kevin P. Farley), the Greene's exterminator, overhears and says he'd love to go. Cornered, Larry agrees to the date.The next morning, Leon reports that his interview went well: \"I'm a flipping a** right now!\" Today, Loretta has a job interview and Larry's offered to drive her. But first, his father, Nat (Shelley Berman), stops by and reports that he had a wonderful massage and is now in love with his masseuse Lisa (Dorian Frankel) because of the special love she showed him, and he wants to buy her a present. Before Larry can set him straight, Cheryl calls out for him. She wants wheat toast. Larry balks, saying the toast will take \"a year\" and Loretta has an interview, but Cheryl insists, accusing Larry of not caring about her. Larry runs down to make toast, pausing Leon's toast to do so. When he brings her limp bread instead of toast, Cheryl rejects it but Loretta is shouting for him that she's late and he has to go. He grabs the wrong cell phone as he runs out.An hour late to her interview, Loretta loses the job and is angry. Blaming the toaster, Larry insists they buy a new one. At the store, Larry sees Loretta checking out a cute guy and comments, but Loretta claims he's not her shade. Larry spots Jean shopping and goes over to apologize. Talking loudly and gesturing broadly, he gets his message across that he was joking about her dog looking like a rat. He also tries to explain the misunderstanding with Hal.She accepts his apology and beats a hasty retreat. But later, when Larry is explaining to his father that he hired the masseuse to give him a happy ending, Jean sees Larry making a yanking gesture from across the store and is again offended. Larry leaves a message for Hal to call him on his cell so he can explain this latest misunderstanding.Larry gets a call on his cell phone, intended for Leon, by a man \"prepared to make you an offer.\" Thinking it's a telemarketer, Larry tells him off, and Leon loses the job.

But Larry denies that Leon got a call about a job and Leon denies he answered a call from Hal. When Mike arrives to be Larry's date for 'Grease,' Leon questions him at the door like an overprotective father, while the two men wait for Larry. Larry finally comes down and they head off to the play. Larry and Mike take their seats between Nat and the masseuse Lisa, and Susie and Jeff. But before the show starts, Jean stomps up and causes a scene, angrily signing to Susie that Larry made racist comments to Hal on the phone. When Jean's dog escapes in the auditorium, Nat yells \"it's a rat!\" Mike springs into action to exterminate it and stomps it to death before Lisa stops him with her screams \"It's a dog!\" The audience flees, horrified.Mike drops Larry off at home, the night having been a bust and shake hands at Larry's front door as they part ways.

Joe is offended that Larry didn't offer him a tip for this task. Jerry tells Larry about this slight to Joe at Jason's book signing in the evening. Larry argues that he asked Mocha Joe for a favor and a favor implies no tipping. Jason has launched a book called \"Acting Without Acting\". Larry is supposed to head to Cheryl's right after the book signing. At the event, Julia, who is hosting the party, calls on Larry and scolds him for putting his wet glass on her antique table without a coaster. She wants Larry to pay $500 to fix the table.

He is stunned to discover that the role of Amanda, George's ex-wife, is now being played by Virginia (whose neck is better).Just then the doorbell rings: It's Cheryl, explaining she quit too, because it wasn't the same without Larry. They watch the show together, agreeing that George and Amanda belong together -- as do they.

Larry asks Cheryl to give Maria Sofia acting lessons and to record an audition tape. At a dinner party at Jeff and Susie's, Larry talks with Freddy Funkhouser, who has bought a hotel and Larry tells him he wants to curate the minibar. At dinner, Larry's cousin Andy and his wife Cassie sit at the middle of table, which causes problems because they are at the center of attention, boring everyone with their conversation. Eventually, Larry and Freddy take over the middle seats and the rest of the dinner party goes smoothly. They talk about taking the advice from someone who has stage 4 cancer and the wisdom they would have. Cheryl tries to film an audition tape for Maria Sofia, but it goes terribly due to Maria Sofia having no acting skills. Larry goes shopping for the minibar and presents it to Freddy and his associates, but they do not like it. Larry and Jeff go to see Marcos at his restaurant, where Jeff pretends to have stage 4 cancer and offers advice to Marcos to not let her daughter become an actor, which he takes. Maria Sofia sees Cheryl again and Maria thinks Cheryl has stolen her jacket after giving her a compliment on it prior. Maria uses this rage while doing a scene and gets into an altercation with her and Ted, all while the camera is still filming. The Hulu executives see the tape and think it is hilarious and cast her in the show."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-12-02T14:45:34.376240Z","updated_at":"2024-12-02T16:57:58.188125Z","inner_id":20,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
