          As an engineering student, I am often told that I can use my new-found
          knowledge and technical expertise to help change the world for the
          better. This has always inspired in me a determination to push the
          boundaries of technology and help to nudge humanity forward into a
          utopian, post-scarcity future in which all struggles are a distant
          memory. I therefore naturally decided that a greater understanding of
          the HBO-series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, would contribute massively to
          this dream.

          Penicillin was discovered accidentally, as were microwaves, x-rays,
          pace-makers. Even Play-Doh. Throughout this project I have been
          accutely aware that even the analysis of one episode, might lead to
          the discovery of a cure to a terminal illness or even a new childs
          toy. I haven't discovered either of those yet, but I also might have
          unknowingly, that's the trouble with trying to discover something
          accidentally I guess.

          Anyway, I think it was Einstein or someone equally important, that
          wrote 'Larry David's writing is the key to humanities' greatest
          secrets and possibly the meaning of life' (I might be paraphrasing). I
          am astonished that this analysis has been left to an under-graduate
          student, clearly government research-funding needs to be
          reprioritised. Nonetheless, I have dedicated myself to this research
          entirely, possibly at the expense of my behaviour-of-dynamic-systems
          revision, but I am convinced that the humanitarian impact of this work
          will be worth the significant cost to my career prospects.
